# Chrome OS P2P Updates Chrome App

This Chrome App gives you a detailed view of all Chrome OS P2P Cached Updates
available in your local network. It uses the brand new `chrome.mdns` API to
discover file updates advertised via a DNS-SD service. Read [Chromium p2p
README](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/master/p2p/README)
to understand how this works.
